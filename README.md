# RAVE
## Radio Aware Voice Engine

RAVE is an Android application that provides text communication via peer-to-peer Bluetooth and data connections. Multiple RAVE devices can form a multi-hop network capable of extending communication over longer distances. The next step for the application is to add push-to-talk audio messages.

RAVEâ€™s range can be extended via a network of relay nodes. These inexpensive single-board computer devices communicate over non-line-of-sight radio frequencies to greatly increase the range of messages.

RAVE is built on the **Clatter** platform. Comprehensive documentation on Clatter's features and architecture, as well as the integrating it into other applications, can be found [here](https://github.com/commotionwireless/clatter).


### Android (COMING SOON)
The Android application for RAVE is still under active development, but will be available soon. Development information and status is on the [wiki](https://github.com/commotionwireless/rave).

### RAVE LoRa Relay
The RAVE Relay is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi in order to serve as a relay to propagate RAVE messages over long distances.
